# Weather App

This is my version of the TrueCoders weather app project. Working on this app helped me improve on my JavaScript DOM manipulation skills. I used HTML templates for the first time on this project and feel like I have come a long way with DOM manipulation. A live deployment is available on vercel [here](https://weather-app-tc.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

I built this app with HTML, CSS, Webpack, TypeScript, SASS and Bootstrap.

## Functionality

The user enters a city name into the text input and chooses a state from the State dropdown. Upon submitting the form, the weather api is called and a card appears with the current weather conditions on it.
